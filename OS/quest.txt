Let the time taken to switch from user mode to kernel mode of execution be T1 while time taken to
switch between two user processes be T2 . Which of the following is correct?
A. T1 > T2
B. T1 = T2
C. T1 < T2
D. Nothing can be said about the relation between T1 and T2.
ANSWER: C

A process executes the following segment of code :
for(i = 1; i <= n; i++)
{fork ();}
The number of child processes created is
A. n
B. ((n(n+1)/2))
C. (2^n)-1
D. (3^n)-1
ANSWER: C

Consider the following code fragment:
if (fork() == 0)
{
a = a + 5;
printf("%d, %p n", a, &a);
}
else
{
a = a - 5;
printf ("%d, %p n", a,& a);
}
Let u,v be the values printed by the parent process and x,y be the values printed by the child process. Which one of the following is TRUE?
A. u=x+10 and v=y
B. u=x+10 and v!=y
C. u+10=x and v=y
D. u+10=x and v!=y
ANSWER: D

A processor needs software interrupt to
A. test the interrupt system of the processor
B. implement co-routines
C. obtain system services which need execution of privileged instructions

D. return from subroutine
ANSWER: C

System calls are usually invoked by using
A. a software interrupt
B. polling
C. an indirect jump
D. a privileged instruction
ANSWER: A

Which combination of the following features will suffice to characterize an OS as a multiprogrammed
OS?
a. More than one program may be loaded into main memory at the same time for execution
b. If a program waits for certain events such as I/O, another program is immediately scheduled for
execution
c. If the execution of a program terminates, another program is immediately scheduled for
execution.
A. (a)
B. (a) and (b)
C. (a) and (c)
D. (a), (b) and (c)
ANSWER: B

A scheduling algorithm assigns priority proportional to the waiting time of a process. Every process
starts with zero (the lowest priority). The scheduler re-evaluates the process priorities every time
units and decides the next process to schedule. Which one of the following is TRUE if the processes
have no I/O operations and all arrive at time zero?
A. This algorithm is equivalent to the first-come-first-serve algorithm.
B. This algorithm is equivalent to the round-robin algorithm.
C. This algorithm is equivalent to the shortest-job-first algorithm.
D. This algorithm is equivalent to the shortest-remaining-time-first algorithm.
ANSWER: B

A critical section is a program segment
A. which should run in a certain amount of time
B. which avoids deadlocks
C. where shared resources are accessed
D. which should be executed without preemption
ANSWER: C
